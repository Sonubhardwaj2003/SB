//As the name suggests, Object-Oriented Programming or Java OOPs concept refers to languages that use objects in programming, they use objects as a primary source to implement what is to happen in the code. Objects are seen by the viewer or user, performing tasks you assign.

// Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc. in programming. The main aim of OOPs is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.


//Abstraction ,hiding internal details ang showing only required features.
//Encapculation ,cover all the things in a single box 
//Inheritance means specialization ,modification in somthing to get ith new features
//polymorphism means generalization, we are talk about whole group not for a specific one ,taking input from user not decleraing  in the code.

// Object ,everything in the world that is define on the basis of their property and their behaviour called objects
